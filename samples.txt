TASK 1: 
create functions:
vector3 [x] [y] [z]
v3x [v3]
v3y [v3]
v3z [v3]
so that
v3x vector3 A B C = A
v3y vector3 A B C = B
v3z vector3 A B C = C
SOLUTION:
vector3 x y z is pair x pair y z
v3x v3 is first v3
v3y v3 is first second v3
v3z v3 is second second v3

TASK 2:
create functions:
zero
inc [x]
sum [x] [y]
diff [x] [y]
less [x] [y]
greater [x] [y]
SOLUTION:
zero is nil
inc x is pair nil x
sum x y is
